# Contains the ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding that grants necessary permissions
# to the operator SA. It adds a prefix to both of them to differentiate the ClusterRole
# from the one that should be created in the member cluster directly. This is needed
# because operator-sdk aggregates all ClusterRoles that are applied to the operator SA into one.
# So having two ClusterRoles with different names solves the problem.
